# 🎓 Student Data Management System  

A Python-based project to practice **OOP, file handling, and error handling** by building a fully functional Student Data Management System.  
This project was designed to strengthen core Python fundamentals while simulating a real-world system.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced  

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  - `Person` parent class  
  - `Student` subclass  
  - `GraduateStudent` subclass (Inheritance)  
  - Method overriding for `get_status()` (Polymorphism)  

- **Encapsulation:** Keeping student/course data managed within classes  

- **File Handling:** Save and load data (CSV-based persistence)  

- **Error Handling:** Input validation, handling invalid cases gracefully

## 🔮 Next Steps

This was my first project with OOP + File Handling + Error Handling.

Next, I plan to upgrade my previous 🛒 E-Commerce Order Insights project by applying the same concepts for deeper practice.
