    "\n",
    "This simple loop-based project is more powerful than it looks. Counting word frequencies is the foundation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which powers everything from chatbots to search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹Bag-of-Words (BoW)\n",
    "\n",
    "Represents text as a collection of words and their counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"I love AI, I love Python\" → {i: 2, love: 2, ai: 1, python: 1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in text classification, spam detection, topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "Builds on word counts but adjusts them to highlight important words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In 100 documents, “the” appears everywhere → not important. A rare word like “transformer” is more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in search engines, information retrieval, document ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing word frequency patterns (like \"happy\", \"angry\", \"sad\"), we can estimate the sentiment of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in customer reviews, social media monitoring, feedback analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Why This Project Is Great for Data Science & AI\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Teaches loop logic + dictionaries (core Python skills).\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Mimics real-world NLP preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Builds the foundation for advanced tools (like NLTK, spaCy, sklearn)"
