# 🛒 E-Commerce Order Insights v2 (Python Project)

## 💡 Overview
This project is an advanced **Python-based E-Commerce Order Insights system** that cleans, validates, and analyzes order data to extract meaningful business insights.  
The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **data cleaning**, **error handling**, and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using pure Python (no external libraries for V2).
